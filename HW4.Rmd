This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
#Question1a)it¡¯s a sequence, so it can be generated by1 :20
c(1:20)
```
```{r}
#1b) the same as a) but reverse it 
c(20:1)
```
```{r}
#1c)1:20 generates 1,2,3,¡­20, 19:1 generates 19,18¡­1
c(1:20,19:1) 
```
```{r}
#1d)set up a vector and name the vector tmp, contains numbers 4,6,3 in the vector
tmp <- c(4,6,3)
#1e) rep() which can be used for replicating an object, 10 means repeating 10 times
rep(tmp,10)
#1f) repeating the 4,6,3 10 times but the last elment is 4, so the length of the output is 31
rep(tmp,l=31)
#1g)repeat the 4 for 10 times, 6 for 20 times and 3 for 30 times and use rep()
rep(tmp,times=c(10,20,30))
```
```{r}
#Question2 First generate a sequence(3,3.1,3.2¡­5.9,6) each number is add 0.1 to the number before, by = 0.1 meas a step size and a length for the sequence respectively
tmp <- seq(3, 6, by=0.1)
# then use arithmetic functions exp and cox to genenrate the desired operation
exp(tmp)*cos(tmp)
```
```{r}
#Question3a) we create the vector x as in Question2
x <- seq(3,36, by=3)
#create the vector y as in Question2
y <- seq(1,34, by=3)
#then we use vector x and y and perform power on them 
z <- (0.1^x)*(0.2^y)
#b) create the vector to specify the exponents and denominators, which are both the vector(1,2,...25), then use power and divide to get the desired output
(2^(1:25))/(1:25)
```
```{r}
#Question4a) create the vector tmp 
tmp <- 10:100
#then we use take 99 sums of (i^3 + 4i^2) for each i in the vector tmp
sum(tmp^3+4*tmp^2)
#4b)create a vector tmp(1,2..25)
tmp <- 1:25
#then take the 25 sums of (2^i/i + 3^i/i), i in the tmp
sum((2^tmp/tmp) + (3^tmp/tmp^2))
```
```{r}
#question5a) 5.	paste() function takes an arbitrary number of arguments and concatenates them one by one into character strings.
paste("label", 1:30)
```
```{r}
#5b) also use paste funcion but reduce the space between fn and number by sep=""
paste("fn", 1:30, sep="")
```
```{r}
#Question6. Set two random list which choose 250 numbers from the list(0,1,2¡­.999) and set each random list be the same when operate it everytime .
set.seed(50) 
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T) 
yVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T) 
#6a)get the difference of  yn and x(n-1) terms by negative index
yVec[-1]-xVec[-length(xVec)]
#6b)get sinyn/cosyn+1 by negative index
sin(yVec[-length(yVec)])/cos(xVec[-1])
#6c)from x1 to xn-2 there are 248 numbers, and from x2 to xn-1 correspond to 2,3...249 and from x3 to xn correspond to 3,4...250 and then use plus and minus to get desired operation
xVec[1:248]+2*xVec[2:249]-xVec[3:250]
#6d)  set up a vector of all xi'x by using indexes, then add each value in the vector by  sum() function.
sum(exp(-xVec[-1])/(xVec[-length(xVec)]+10))
#Question7a)use the condition yVec>600 to find all the values
yVec[yVec>600]
#7b)first create a sequence whose length is yVec
indexs <- (1:length(yVec))
#then use the condition in a) to find the index positions whose vallues are greater than 600
indexs[yVec>600]
#7c)do the same as we did in 7b) except that we find the indecx positions in xVec correspond to those in yVec
xVec[yVec>600]
#7d)find the mean value of x1,x2...xn 
xbar <- mean(xVec)
#then we take the absolute value of xVec-xbar, take the square root of the absolute value. set up a vector contains all the square root values.
sqrt(abs(xVec-xbar))
#7e)first find the maximum value in yVec
maxvalue <- max(yVec)
#then within the 200 of the maximun value find the number of values in yVec
length(yVec(yVec>maxvalue-200))
#7f)if the numbers in xVec divide by 2 is equals o, that means it is divisible by 2. so use mod operator.
sum(xVec%%2==0)
#7g)first we need find the order of incresing values in yVec by order(yVec), then sort the numbers in vector xVec in terms of that order
xVec[order(yVec)]
#7h) index position can be presented by a sequence(1,4,7...250) and each step is increasing by3 then pick out yVec elements at the at these index positions
c[seq(1,250, by=3)]

```
```{r}
#Question8 first generate two sequences, (2,4,6...38) and (3,5,7...39) name 
a <- seq(2,28, by=2)
b <- seq(3,39, by=2)
#add the culmulative sum of (sequence a divided by b), then add 1 to the sum
1 + sum(cumprod(a/b))
```
